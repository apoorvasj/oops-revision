<h1>How does POP work?</h1>
We create functions to implement program logic. We pass objects to functions, functions operate on data and return results.
Functions and data are <b>separate entities</b>. However POP separates properties (objects) and behaviours (functions). 
<br>
<br>
POP leads to code like:
<br>
<br>
<code>eat(you, apple);</code>

<h2>Object definition</h2>
A piece of memory to store values. (I find this definition more intuitive than just an object is an instance of a class.)
<h1>Moving towards OOP</h1>
We want code to look like:
<br>
<br>
<code>you.eat(apple);</code>
<br>
<br>
<b>Advantages</b>
<li>Properties and behaviours are not separate.</li>
<li>Programs are more intuitive.</li>
<li>High degree of code reusability</li>
<li>Code is easier to extend.</li>
